# Dog_Emotion_Basic
Here, I've tried to train the CNN Model to analyse whether your dog is happy, sad, neutral or angry. This project helps you get the basic idea of how to train the dataset which is available to you. Here, the dataset contains a total of 15,926 individual items, segregated in the categories already mentioned.
This has been done after studying the data set made available on Kaggle. 
Be it any project, major or minor, always has a scope of inmprovement in the same fashion as this. 
Right from applying new models for a better accuracy to studying even larger datasets, many things can be done with the scope of time.
